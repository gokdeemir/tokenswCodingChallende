Instead of creating a QR code, the user receives a payment notification in the pending payments tab within the application.
And when you click on this notification, it goes to the detail page.
He approves payosy by clicking the confirmation button on the detail page.
 
In my backend case, the mobile party will be able to upload the qr code to the system and continue its operations with the qr code text received. You can perform your transactions by sending the necessary data to the backend in accordance with the models you will find in the API documentation, the link of which you can find below.

Also, when you install the application, you can find the api documentation at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/.
